## 💡 How It Works

- The app runs in a loop, showing a menu with options.
- Tasks are stored in a Python list as dictionaries.
- Each task has a `title` and `done` status (True or False).
- The user can add, view, mark, or delete tasks until they choose to exit.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Variables
- Lists & Dictionaries
- Functions
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
- User Input (`input()`)
- Error Handling (`try-except`)
- Basic Console Output

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements (For later)

- 🗂 Save tasks to a file using `json` (so they persist after you close the app)
- ⏰ Add due dates (Done,feature has been added)
- 🌈 Add color using the `colorama` library
